# Project Title

It's so K!

## Project Overview

It's so K! is an online shop dedicated for online merchandise. This project is the project i passed for my midterm project in my 3rd Year in college last year (November 2023). This is not entirely mine since i just modify the contents of this project from a tutorial I found on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEMrD9t85v4&t=1207s). This project is the reflection of what I knew and what I could do that time
